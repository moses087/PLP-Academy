#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is a discipline that entails writing code for computers and solving world real problems through technology. It's importance include ensuring high quality softwares, improving efficiency and productivity, supporting complex system developments, reducing costs and risks, and enabling innovation.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
The Advent of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s). Before the 1960s, software was developed using ad-hoc methods, often resulting in unstructured and difficult-to-maintain code. The introduction of structured programming revolutionized software development by promoting better organization and readability of code.
The Birth of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s).Object-oriented programming brought a new paradigm that modeled software around "objects" rather than actions. Simula, developed in the 1960s, was one of the first object-oriented languages, but Smalltalk in the 1970s and C++ in the 1980s popularized the approach.
The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (2001). The release of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 marked a significant shift from traditional, rigid development models like Waterfall to more flexible, interactive approaches. Agile emphasized collaboration, customer feedback, and the ability to respond to change.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: This phase involves defining the scope and purpose of the project. Stakeholders analyze requirements, estimate resources, and create a project plan.
Requirements Analysis: Detailed gathering and documentation of functional and non-functional requirements.
Design: The system architecture is designed based on the requirements gathered. This includes both high-level design (architecture) and detailed design (module design).
Implementation (Coding) : Developers write the code according to the specifications created during the design phase. This is typically the most resource-intensive phase.
Testing: The software is rigorously tested to identify and fix bugs. This phase includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
Deployment: The finished software is released to users. It may first be deployed in a limited way (beta testing) before full-scale release.
Maintenance: After deployment, the software may require updates, bug fixes, or new features over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
